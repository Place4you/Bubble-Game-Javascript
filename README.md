## Overview

This project is a Bubble game developed using JavaScript and SCSS. It is an interactive game where a menu appears at the start. When the user clicks "Play," the game starts with multiple bubbles on the screen. Each bubble has a unique hit number, and when the user hits the bubble with the given number, their score increases by 10. The total time for the game is 30 seconds, and at the end, the user can play again by clicking the "Play again" button.
